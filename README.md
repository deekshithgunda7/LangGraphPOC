Build Basic ChatBot using LangGraph Graph API
Components of LangGraph

1 - Edge  -- Link 2 nodes
2 - Node  -- Implementation of any workflow(EX:ytvideo to transcript generator)
3 - State  -- Here you save the output of one of the workflow and can be used in any workflow as per your graph


- maintained state among the nodes is called stateGraph
- Graph API
- Functional API

        LLM + prompt

START --> ChatBot  --> END

   External Tools integration  --  reACT Agent

   We have stateGraph and memory..both are different

Lets implement above   

In code

add_messages is called reducer

In a session,when have a conversation every out put is saved in state graph on a variable which holds a list of items.So with the help of reducers we can append any type of data onto list rather than overidding it



lets build it from scratch

ReACT Agent Usage plays important role -- > Act , Observe and Reason  ---> LLM to toolnode for(AI news) and again LLm to ToolNode(for 5 * 5) and to end this is reACT agent Architecture\



MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.
Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts)â€”enabling them to access key information and perform tasks.
